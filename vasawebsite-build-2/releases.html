                    <p>Scottish post-rock band VASA are delighted to announce that their long-awaited second album, Heroics, will be released on 21st February 2020. To celebrate their return, the band have today revealed the video for ‘Heroics’—the title track and lead single for the record, which is out now on all good digital service providers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also announced today are a run of February 2020 UK/EU tour dates and festival appearances, with support on select dates from Thank You Scientist (see below for full listings).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The second album from the quartet, Heroics is a sonic exploration in coming to terms with the pains of ageing by reconnecting with our own individual pasts and the histories of generations before. Marking a significant growth in the band’s trademark celtic post-rock sound, the album unlocks new depths to their creativity, drawing from the invincibility of childhood, the chaos of adolescence, and the uncertainties of adulthood.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                    “As we grow older we often start to disconnect from our past,” say the band of the record. “We are taught that in order to grow, we must leave that which came before behind. We must become adults. But, in reality, as we become older we begin to realise our parents and our grandparents have experienced this same disconnect too. The same insecurities, the same faults, the same vulnerabilities.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “This album is the emotional representation of that feeling and the rebellion against it, through the act of embracing who we never really stopped being. As such, Heroics does not aim to be one definitive story, but all of our stories. It is an invitation for the listener to come on a shared journey which delves into our collective past, where they can choose to colour in the blanks with their own experience.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Composed over three years, Heroics was brought to life between 45-A-Side and Trapdoor Studios with the help of producer Tom Peters (Wot Gorilla?, Alpha Male Tea Party, The Hyena Kill, Cleft, Body Hound) in the summer of 2019. The album is an ambitious concept record broken into the key stages of life: childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, within which the band explore a whole new range of tonality. Shifting from the childlike bounce of the title track, to the electronic pulses that ebb and flow over ‘Prom Night’, all the way through to the album’s viciously dark yet uplifting conclusion, VASA have created a brazenly joyous yet melancholic soundscape that traverses a lifetime.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p>
                    Since forming in October 2011, the quartet have seen a rush of support from national press and huge swathes of the post-rock community, giving way to tour dates with experimental music heavyweights and hotly tipped newcomers such as Black Peaks, Deafheaven, Maybeshewill, This Town Needs Guns, Brontide, Poly-Math, and Body Hound, plus appearances at ArcTanGent, T in The Park, Wickerman Festival, PORTALS and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Heroics is the band’s first release since 2016 stand alone double A-side single ‘Burst’/’Open’, which was preceded only by their critically-acclaimed 2015 debut album Colours. Despite being their first ever release, in a very niche genre, the record garnered support from major national press outlets including The Independent, The National Scot, The Scotsman, PROG magazine, Clash Magazine, The iNewspaper, and Total Guitar, with further coverage at The Skinny, Gold Flake Paint, and New Noise Magazine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A continuation of their unrelentingly upbeat and joyful approach to the occasionally tawdry world of post-rock, Heroics sees them as riotous and celebratory as ever. Thankfully, despite their maturation, VASA are still the kind of band that consistently remind us that this whole music lark is meant to be fun, right?
